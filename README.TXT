HubSpot_ETL Script
==================

Purpose:
--------
This script automates the extraction, transformation, and delivery of daily data files from a source network location to a destination network folder for further processing or archival. It is designed to handle files generated by a database export, specifically those beginning with "EXTRACT." (such as EXTRACT.CARD, EXTRACT.DATA, etc.), and to securely mask sensitive data before delivery.

How It Works:
-------------
1. **Locate Source Files:**  
   The script searches the source folder for a subfolder named with yesterday's date (format: YYYYMMDD). It then identifies all files in that subfolder whose names start with "EXTRACT.".

2. **Copy to Staging:**  
   All matching files are copied to a local staging folder. If the staging folder does not exist, it is created automatically.

3. **Mask Sensitive Data:**  
   For the file named EXTRACT.CARD, the script reads its contents, masks all but the last four digits of the third column (typically a card number), and saves the masked version in the staging folder in the same format as the original.

4. **Deliver to Network Folder:**  
   All files (except EXTRACT.CARD, which is replaced by its masked version) are copied from staging to a dated subfolder in the destination network folder.

5. **Archive Delivery:**  
   The script creates a ZIP archive of the delivered files in the network folder, named after the date (YYYYMMDD.zip).

6. **Cleanup:**  
   After archiving, the script removes the dated subfolder and its contents from the network folder, leaving only the ZIP archive. It also cleans up old files from the staging folder as needed.

7. **Logging and Timing:**  
   All major actions and errors are logged. The script also tracks and reports the total runtime in minutes.

This process ensures secure, automated, and auditable delivery of daily extract files with sensitive
